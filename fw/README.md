# myDV-nano

In this part of the webinterface, you have the option to upload new FW in the myDV-nano.
- note that the first releases of the myDV-nano doe not have the harware support for this!

Also there is a binary-folder that includes odified scripts, and a fan-controller.
- CPU-temp is converted to a PWM-signal to control a fan on the base of the newest release.

A addon option will become available, but will need tinkering to get it conncted!
